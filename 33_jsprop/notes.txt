Bubble and capture are 2 "propagating" mechanisms that are triggered by events. The third parameter of addEventListener decides which mechanism is to be used, with false being bubble(the default) and true being capture. When an event is triggered with bubble, it is first handled by the element itself, and "bubbling" it's way up the parent chain to the "window". The opposite is true for the capture mechanism.
